Release Candidate # 2
=====================

1.      Make sure you close down your VM's before upgrading
2.      Note that the naming scheme for VM's and LVM partitions has changed
3.      Note the custom SQL table has changed, this is reflected in the docs
        new details;

CREATE TABLE `vdc_pool` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `store` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `path` varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL,
  `host` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `size` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `store_UNIQUE` (`store`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=1729 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

4.      A number of bugs have been fixed, but in particular the use of
        mlockall was amended to fix an issue with the client cache
        crashing under certain circumstances. (typically this would
        cause a number of unrelated caches to crash as parts of them
        would be swapped out during inactivity)

5.      The next release will contain some performance enhancements for
        uncached reads, note that the performance you see will depend
        on the quality of your equipment, but currently uncached reads
        on a 1G network will deliver a throughput of between 45 and 90
        Mbytes per sec. Cached reads will vary depending on the speed
        of your SSD, using 2xSSD's we're seeing up to 800Mb/sec for
        SSD cache and around 3G/sec for page cache.
